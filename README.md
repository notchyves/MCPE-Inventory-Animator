# MCPE Inventory Animator Tool

## 📄 About
This tool allows you to take a GIF file, and convert it into an animated inventory! This tool only works for the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft.

## 😡 Limits
Unfortuanetly, due to the Bedrock UI engine, only 40 frames can be rendered, that are 352 x 352. If it was to become bigger, than only 20 frames would be able to be rendered. If we push Minecraft to far, it may be buggy, laggy, and crash often.
